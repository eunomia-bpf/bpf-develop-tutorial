# Compile Once, Run Everywhere for userspace trace with eBPF and BTF

eBPF, short for extended Berkeley Packet Filter, is a powerful and versatile technology used in modern Linux systems. It allows for the running of sandboxed programs in a virtual machine-like environment within the kernel, providing a safe way to extend the capabilities of the kernel without the risk of crashing the system or compromising security.

The term "co-re" in the context of eBPF stands for "Compile Once, Run Everywhere". This is a key feature of eBPF that addresses a major challenge: the compatibility of eBPF programs across different kernel versions. The CO-RE of eBPF program can help us to run the eBPF program on different kernel versions without the need for recompilation.

With eBPF Uprobe, you can also trace userspace applications and access their internal data structures. However, there is no CO-RE practice for userspace. This blog introduces a new approach to leverage CO-RE for user-space applications, ensuring eBPF programs remain compatible across different application versions without the need for multiple compilations. For example, you may not need to maintain a separate eBPF program for each version of OpenSSL when capturing SSL/TLS plaintext data from encrypted traffic.

This article is part of the eBPF Developer Tutorial, and for more detailed content, you can visit [here](https://eunomia.dev/tutorials/). The source code is available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpf-developer-tutorial).

## Why we need CO-RE?

- **Kernel Dependencies**: Traditional eBPF programs are tightly coupled with the specific Linux kernel version they are compiled for. This is because they rely on specific internal data structures and kernel APIs which can change between kernel versions.
- **Portability Issues**: If you wanted to run an eBPF program on different Linux systems with different kernel versions, you'd traditionally have to recompile the eBPF program for each kernel version, which is a cumbersome and inefficient process.

### The Co-RE Solution

- **Abstracting Kernel Dependencies**: Co-RE enables eBPF programs to be more portable by abstracting away specific kernel dependencies. This is achieved through the use of BPF Type Format (BTF) and relocations.
- **BPF Type Format (BTF)**: BTF provides rich type information about data structures and functions in the kernel. This metadata allows eBPF programs to understand the layout of kernel structures at runtime.
- **Relocations**: eBPF programs compiled with Co-RE support contain relocations that are resolved at load time. These relocations adjust the program's references to kernel data structures and functions according to the actual layout and addresses in the running kernel.

### Advantages of Co-RE

1. **Write Once, Run Anywhere**: eBPF programs compiled with Co-RE can run on different kernel versions without the need for recompilation. This greatly simplifies the deployment and maintenance of eBPF programs in diverse environments.
2. **Safety and Stability**: Co-RE maintains the safety guarantees of eBPF, ensuring that programs do not crash the kernel and adhere to security constraints.
3. **Ease of Development**: Developers don't need to worry about the specifics of each kernel version, which simplifies the development of eBPF programs.

## Problem: userspace application CO-RE

The eBPF also supports tracing userspace applications. Uprobe is a user-space probe that allows dynamic instrumentation in user-space programs. The probe locations include function entry, specific offsets, and function returns.

The BTF is designed for the kernel and generated from vmlinux, it can help the eBPF program to be easily compatible with different kernel versions.

The userspace application, however, also need CO-RE. For example, the SSL/TLS uprobe is widely used to capture the plaintext data from the encrypted traffic. It is implemented with the userspace library, such as OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS, etc. The userspace application and libraries also has different versions, it would be complex if we need to compile and maintain the eBPF program for each version.

Here is some new tools and methods to help us enable CO-RE for userspace application.

## No BTF for userspace program

This is a simple uprobe example, it can capture the function call and arguments of the `add_test` function in the userspace program. You can add `#define BPF_NO_PRESERVE_ACCESS_INDEX` in the `uprobe.bpf.c` to make sure the eBPF program can be compiled without BTF for `struct data`.


```c
#define BPF_NO_GLOBAL_DATA
#define BPF_NO_PRESERVE_ACCESS_INDEX
#include <vmlinux.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_tracing.h>

struct data {
        int a;
        int c;
        int d;
};

SEC("uprobe/examples/btf-base:add_test")
int BPF_UPROBE(add_test, struct data *d)
{
    int a = 0, c = 0;
    bpf_probe_read_user(&a, sizeof(a), &d->a);
    bpf_probe_read_user(&c, sizeof(c), &d->c);
    bpf_printk("add_test(&d) %d + %d = %d\n", a, c,  a + c);
    return a + c;
}

char LICENSE[] SEC("license") = "Dual BSD/GPL";
```

Then, we have two different versions of the userspace program, `examples/btf-base` and `examples/btf-base-new`. The struct `data` is different in the two versions.

`examples/btf-base`:

```c
// use a different struct
struct data {
        int a;
        int c;
        int d;
};

int add_test(struct data *d) {
    return d->a + d->c;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    struct data d = {1, 3, 4};
    printf("add_test(&d) = %d\n", add_test(&d));
    return 0;
}
```

`examples/btf-base-new`:

```c
struct data {
        int a;
        int b;
        int c;
        int d;
};

int add_test(struct data *d) {
    return d->a + d->c;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    struct data d = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    printf("add_test(&d) = %d\n", add_test(&d));
    return 0;
}
```

We can use pahole and clang to generate the btf for each version. make example and generate btf:

```sh
make -C example # it's like: pahole --btf_encode_detached base.btf btf-base.o
```

The we execute the eBPF program with the userspace program. for `btf-base`:

```sh
sudo ./uprobe examples/btf-base 
```

And also the userspace program:

```console
$ examples/btf-base
add_test(&d) = 4
```

We will see:

```console
$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe\
           <...>-25458   [000] ...11 27694.081465: bpf_trace_printk: add_test(&d) 1 + 3 = 4
```

For `btf-base-new`:

```sh
sudo ./uprobe examples/btf-base-new
```

And also the userspace program:

```console
$ examples/btf-base-new
add_test(&d) = 4
```

But we will see:

```console
$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe\
           <...>-25809   [001] ...11 27828.314224: bpf_trace_printk: add_test(&d) 1 + 2 = 3
```

The result is different, because the struct `data` is different in the two versions. The eBPF program can't be compatible with different versions of the userspace program.

## Use BTF for userspace program

Comment the `#define BPF_NO_PRESERVE_ACCESS_INDEX` in the `uprobe.bpf.c` to make sure the eBPF program can be compiled with BTF for `struct data`.

```c
#define BPF_NO_GLOBAL_DATA
// #define BPF_NO_PRESERVE_ACCESS_INDEX
#include <vmlinux.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_tracing.h>

#ifndef BPF_NO_PRESERVE_ACCESS_INDEX
#pragma clang attribute push (__attribute__((preserve_access_index)), apply_to = record)
#endif

struct data {
        int a;
        int c;
        int d;
};

#ifndef BPF_NO_PRESERVE_ACCESS_INDEX
#pragma clang attribute pop
#endif


SEC("uprobe/examples/btf-base:add_test")
int BPF_UPROBE(add_test, struct data *d)
{
    int a = 0, c = 0;
    bpf_probe_read_user(&a, sizeof(a), &d->a);
    bpf_probe_read_user(&c, sizeof(c), &d->c);
    bpf_printk("add_test(&d) %d + %d = %d\n", a, c,  a + c);
    return a + c;
}

char LICENSE[] SEC("license") = "Dual BSD/GPL";
```

The record of `struct data` is preserved in the eBPF program. Then, we can use the `btf-base.btf` to compile the eBPF program.

Merge user btf with kernel btf, so we have a complete btf for the kernel and userspace:

```sh
./merge-btf /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux examples/base.btf target-base.btf
```

Then we execute the eBPF program with the userspace program. for `btf-base`:

```console
$ sudo ./uprobe examples/btf-base target-base.btf
...
libbpf: prog 'add_test': relo #1: patched insn #4 (ALU/ALU64) imm 0 -> 0
libbpf: prog 'add_test': relo #2: <byte_off> [7] struct data.c (0:1 @ offset 4)
libbpf: prog 'add_test': relo #2: matching candidate #0 <byte_off> [133110] struct data.c (0:1 @ offset 4)
libbpf: prog 'add_test': relo #2: patched insn #11 (ALU/ALU64) imm 4 -> 4
...
```

Execute the userspace program and get result:

```console
$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
[sudo] password for yunwei37: 
           <...>-26740   [001] ...11 28180.156220: bpf_trace_printk: add_test(&d) 1 + 3 = 4

```

Also, we do the same for another version of the userspace program `btf-base-new`:

```console
$ ./merge-btf /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux examples/base-new.btf target-base-new.btf
$ sudo ./uprobe examples/btf-base-new target-base-new.btf
....

libbpf: elf: symbol address match for 'add_test' in 'examples/btf-base-new': 0x1140

```

The result is correct:

```console
$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
[sudo] password for yunwei37: 
           <...>-26740   [001] ...11 28180.156220: bpf_trace_printk: add_test(&d) 1 + 3 = 4
```
