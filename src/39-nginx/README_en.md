Performance-Critical Functions in Nginx

Nginx is a highly optimized event-driven server, and its performance-critical functions typically include those involved in request processing, response generation, and event handling. Some key functions that you might consider hooking into are:

ngx_http_process_request: This function is responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests. Itâ€™s a good place to monitor the start of request handling.

ngx_http_upstream_send_request: In scenarios where Nginx is acting as a reverse proxy, this function handles sending requests to upstream servers.

ngx_http_finalize_request: This function finalizes the processing of an HTTP request, including sending the response. Hooking into this can help measure request handling time.

ngx_event_process_posted: This function processes queued events, which is part of the Nginx event loop.

ngx_handle_read_event: Responsible for handling read events from sockets. This is crucial for monitoring network I/O performance.

ngx_writev_chain: This function handles sending responses back to the client, often in conjunction with the write event loop.

`Uprobe` in kernel mode eBPF runtime may also cause relatively large performance overhead. In this case, you can also consider using user mode eBPF runtime, such as [bpftime](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime). bpftime is a user mode eBPF runtime based on LLVM JIT/AOT. It can run eBPF programs in user mode, compatible with kernel mode eBPF and can be faster for `uprobe`.

## Using bpftrace to trace nginx functions

```bt
#!/usr/sbin/bpftrace

// Monitor the start of HTTP request processing
uprobe:/usr/sbin/nginx:ngx_http_process_request
{
    printf("HTTP request processing started (tid: %d)\n", tid);
    @start[tid] = nsecs;
}

// Monitor when an HTTP request is finalized
uretprobe:/usr/sbin/nginx:ngx_http_finalize_request
/@start[tid]/
{
    $elapsed = nsecs - @start[tid];
    printf("HTTP request processed in %d ns (tid: %d)\n", $elapsed, tid);
    delete(@start[tid]);
}

// Monitor the start of sending a request to an upstream server
uprobe:/usr/sbin/nginx:ngx_http_upstream_send_request
{
    printf("Upstream request sending started (tid: %d)\n", tid);
    @upstream_start[tid] = nsecs;
}

// Monitor when the upstream request is sent
uretprobe:/usr/sbin/nginx:ngx_http_upstream_send_request
/@upstream_start[tid]/
{
    $elapsed = nsecs - @upstream_start[tid];
    printf("Upstream request sent in %d ns (tid: %d)\n", $elapsed, tid);
    delete(@upstream_start[tid]);
}

// Monitor the start of event processing
uprobe:/usr/sbin/nginx:ngx_event_process_posted
{
    printf("Event processing started (tid: %d)\n", tid);
    @event_start[tid] = nsecs;
}

// Monitor when event processing is completed
uretprobe:/usr/sbin/nginx:ngx_event_process_posted
/@event_start[tid]/
{
    $elapsed = nsecs - @event_start[tid];
    printf("Event processed in %d ns (tid: %d)\n", $elapsed, tid);
    delete(@event_start[tid]);
}
```

Run the program, start a nginx and using curl for a request:

```bt
# bpftrace /home/yunwei37/bpf-developer-tutorial/src/39-nginx/trace.bt
Attaching 4 probes...

```
